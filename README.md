# GA_Project4_frontend
This is the front end of a Coin Exchange App built using React.js as part of a MERN stack application.  It allows you to add coins you want to sell, giving them a country of origin, value, and grade, as well as the year the coin was minted.   Once the coin has been add, users can "purchase" the coin by updating the quantity, or deleting it if there is only one of that type of coin.  Before being able to access the list of coins, the user must login and be authenticated with Oauth.
